Drag and drop
	add new item
		on save button - x
		on new item async- TODO
			entering value wipes input box clean
	reordering
		updates db realtime
	delete existing item
	handle ordering of items properly
		new items last in list based off list length.
			moving items in list updates their order (gets final order on 'save')
			this needs to be kept up to date in the view and in the view model as data can be updated on server at any point
			model and server validation on ordering
	
	Really think about server side validation on client requests as the access token can be used to make custom post requests. HOw can this be prevented? 
		What if the user changes the categories URL ID?
		Can additional claims be added?
		validation on order of items - must follow on. max must be length 
	save button to send array back to server
	
force refresh ex[iry under cerrtin conditions
on guard and client services, what happens on failed refresh token? always redirect?

What is stopping a user from modifying the post request nad changing the data to add whatever they want?
	can post requests be signed?
implement post to add new categories

convert catgory items id to long?
Handle no data found on fetch

modularise module
Build API adding/reordering items
build front end submitting new orders
add angular progress spinner while loading
max number of category item groups


		
	my rankings/id
		build hand coded my-rankings/id and have it displayed on my-rankings/id page
		have user accessing my-rankings/id submit a GET for their rankings
		display their rankings (loosely)
		build my=rankings/id table
		replace hard coded my-rankings with db call
		
		build post method for adding new rankings
		build front end sorting and allow this to submit to db on submit/save
		should update page async	
		build post method for adding new rankings category
		should update page async


Build my-rankings/id model - hand built
Build my-rankings GET API - any user
Display rankings in angular and when clicked take you to rankings/id
Build rankings ID in GET API - any user
display this in angular when clicked
2FA
delete user
	change pasword - user password change inserts hashed salted password 
Implement revoke method on refresh token
	look into common  reasons methods for revoking tokens (i.e. too many API requests)
validation on user email format

PROD
	increase access token time
