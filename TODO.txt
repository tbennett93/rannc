Drag and drop
	add new item
		on save button - x
		on new item async- TODO
			entering value wipes input box clean - x
		Can't enter blank - x
		'Enter' also works - x
	
	delete existing item
		on hover, display an 'x'
		on click, delete the item x
		
	
	add check on each db action that the user calling the request owns the data
		can something be added to UserContext?
	
	Create a new user and test that each user can only accses their own data
		
	add try catch around data service in angular
	
	reordering
		
		updates db realtime
		considerations
			if moving item then deleting it quickly. before server catches up, another FE update might have gone through.
			Solution:
				every time an action is performed on a list. SEnd the whole list back to the db?
				if an action is performed between arrays, update both arrays in db
				or
					keep it the same and on error or timeout, show error and refresh the data with db data so client knows what the db holds and is fresh data set
				
			adding new
				adds order as current order +1
			moving
				updates db with new position
			deleting
				cascades order of all other items
				
	
	handle ordering of items properly
		new items last in list based off list length.
			moving items in list updates their order (gets final order on 'save')
			this needs to be kept up to date in the view and in the view model as data can be updated on server at any point
			model and server validation on ordering
	
	
	Build Categories PAge a bit nicer
	
	Really think about server side validation on client requests as the access token can be used to make custom post requests. HOw can this be prevented? 
		What if the user changes the categories URL ID?
		Can additional claims be added?
		validation on order of items - must follow on. max must be length 
	save button to send array back to server

testing
	Create useful tests against everything
lazy loading?
force refresh ex[iry under cerrtin conditions
on guard and client services, what happens on failed refresh token? always redirect?

What is stopping a user from modifying the post request nad changing the data to add whatever they want?
	can post requests be signed?
implement post to add new categories
handle memory eak caused by user leaving paage after sending request and befor receiving response
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35042929/is-it-necessary-to-unsubscribe-from-observables-created-by-http-methods
convert catgory items id to long?
Handle no data found on fetch

modularise module
Build API adding/reordering items
build front end submitting new orders
add angular progress spinner while loading
max number of category item groups

Rename TS javascript files on production so they aren't cached by users


		
	my rankings/id
		build hand coded my-rankings/id and have it displayed on my-rankings/id page
		have user accessing my-rankings/id submit a GET for their rankings
		display their rankings (loosely)
		build my=rankings/id table
		replace hard coded my-rankings with db call
		
		build post method for adding new rankings
		build front end sorting and allow this to submit to db on submit/save
		should update page async	
		build post method for adding new rankings category
		should update page async


Build my-rankings/id model - hand built
Build my-rankings GET API - any user
Display rankings in angular and when clicked take you to rankings/id
Build rankings ID in GET API - any user
display this in angular when clicked
2FA
delete user
	change pasword - user password change inserts hashed salted password 
Implement revoke method on refresh token
	look into common  reasons methods for revoking tokens (i.e. too many API requests)
validation on user email format

PROD
	increase access token time
