need to consider adding group order to the back end (not category order, this has been done. This applies to the order in which they appear on the home page), alternatively, if not dragging and dropping, these could be ordered alphabetically?
	will this need to be a case of separating groups into a sub table with items a  subset of groups?
		This change could probably be isolated to the back end. As long as the APIs are returning the same data?
			There may need to be slight tweaks to the client as item arrays may be nested inside groups
	



Really think about server side validation on client requests as the access token can be used to make custom post requests. HOw can this be prevented? 
	What if the user changes the categories URL ID?
	Can additional claims be added?
	validation on order of items - must follow on. max must be length 
save button to send array back to server

testing
	Create useful tests against everything
lazy loading?
force refresh ex[iry under cerrtin conditions
on guard and client services, what happens on failed refresh token? always redirect?

What is stopping a user from modifying the post request nad changing the data to add whatever they want?
	can post requests be signed?
implement post to add new categories
handle memory eak caused by user leaving paage after sending request and befor receiving response
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35042929/is-it-necessary-to-unsubscribe-from-observables-created-by-http-methods
convert catgory items id to long?
Handle no data found on fetch

modularise module
Build API adding/reordering items
build front end submitting new orders
add angular progress spinner while loading
max number of category item groups

Rename TS javascript files on production so they aren't cached by users

Implement revoke method on refresh token
	look into common  reasons methods for revoking tokens (i.e. too many API requests)
validation on user email format

PROD
