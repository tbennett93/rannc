Ideas
	The array item/property needs to be strongly typed in HTML.
		HOW DO WE GET THE NAME OF THE INDEX/PROPERTY?
		There may be a way around this by looping over the parent array to get the property/object name
		If this doesn't work. Insert all group names into its own array in the class and loop round that
	
	If this doesn't work, create 10 lists, as this will be the maximum and then the HTML/drag drop etc can be hard coded. The drag and drop about may not work if the HTML is created dynamically
		Could we use a directive/component?
	


tidy everything up and make look nice
	consider how this will look with drag and drop. can the items be set and then retrieved later?
		implement a mock up put first to replace items
		
		implement post to add new categories
		post on save?

convert catgory items id to long?
Handle no data found on fetch

modularise module
Build API adding/reordering items
build front end submitting new orders
add angular progress spinner while loading
max number of category item groups


		
	my rankings/id
		build hand coded my-rankings/id and have it displayed on my-rankings/id page
		have user accessing my-rankings/id submit a GET for their rankings
		display their rankings (loosely)
		build my=rankings/id table
		replace hard coded my-rankings with db call
		
		build post method for adding new rankings
		build front end sorting and allow this to submit to db on submit/save
		should update page async	
		build post method for adding new rankings category
		should update page async


Build my-rankings/id model - hand built
Build my-rankings GET API - any user
Display rankings in angular and when clicked take you to rankings/id
Build rankings ID in GET API - any user
display this in angular when clicked
2FA
delete user
	change pasword - user password change inserts hashed salted password 
Implement revoke method on refresh token
	look into common  reasons methods for revoking tokens (i.e. too many API requests)
validation on user email format

PROD
	increase access token time
